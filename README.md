The provided report offers a comprehensive comparison between a Decision Tree model and a Random Forest model in predicting clusters based on selected features from a dataset. It highlights the performance metrics, insights, and managerial implications of each model. The Decision Tree model demonstrates clear decision-making based on feature thresholds and achieves perfect accuracy, while the Random Forest model, despite its higher computational cost, provides comparable accuracy through ensemble learning. Insights from feature importance analysis emphasize the significance of vehicle model and manufacturer in determining cluster membership, along with considerations for performance, fuel type, pricing, and taxation. The report also discusses trade-offs between model complexity, speed, and accuracy, providing guidance for managerial decision-making. Overall, it serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders seeking to understand and leverage the strengths of different machine learning models for clustering tasks.
